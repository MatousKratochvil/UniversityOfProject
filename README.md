# UniversityOfProject

**UniversityOfProject** is a sandbox project created for testing and experimenting with various software development concepts. The project focuses on implementing and exploring Rich Domain Models within a university context.

## Purpose

- **Experimentation**: Test different design patterns, architectural styles, and coding techniques.
- **Domain-Driven Design**: Apply principles of Domain-Driven Design (DDD) to model university entities.
- **Learning**: Serve as a learning platform for understanding complex domain models and their implementations.

## Features

- **Rich Domain Models**: Implementation of entities like Employees, Professors, Departments, Courses, and Projects.
- **Value Objects**: Use of Value Objects for encapsulating domain-specific values (e.g., Name, EmployeeNumber).
- **Inheritance and Polymorphism**: Demonstration of object-oriented principles through class hierarchies.
- **Business Logic Encapsulation**: Encapsulating business rules and logic within domain models.
- **Extensibility**: Designed to be easily extended with new features and experiments.
